# PokerTracker

PokerTracker is a clean, fast web app for logging and analyzing live poker sessions. Record your session details (date, location, variation, blinds, buy‑in, cash‑out, duration, notes) and instantly see how you’re doing with a simple dashboard, chart, and calendar. Filters make it easy to slice results by location, game type, stakes, location type, and date range.

Most poker trackers look ugly as shit and I don't like paying for garbage software, so I built my own.
